			<h3>Wireless emergency alerts (WEAs) are the notifications from the state we receive on our phones about emergencies like Amber Alerts or natural disasters.</h3>
			<p>Using a specific example where WEAs disastrously misinformed the inhabitants of Hawaii about a non-existent ballistic missile, I investigate how the human systems and UI that produce these vital messages can be further streamlined and secured for efficient and accurate messaging.<p>

				<div>
					<h2 class="bold">Background</h2>
					<p><span class="text-accent-color">Wireless emergency alerts (WEAs)</span> were introduced in 2012 as a way of modernizing TV alerts and providing important government updates conveniently via mobile devices.</p>
					<p>Most federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial organizations have the capabilities to send WEAs in order to address emergencies of various scales.</p> 
					<p>More than 30,000 alerts have been sent since its introduction. WEAs are available on all mobile carriers.</p>
					<h3>WEAs are criticized for their ability to cause rapid widespread panic due to the lack of guidance it provides citizens when informing them of important news.</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="padmidsection-medium">
					<h4 class="larger nobottommarginblock-lighter">A Black Swan Occurrence</h4>
					<p>As designers, it is vital to prepare for the worst case scenario, otherwise known as a black swan occurrence, to ensure system fortitude.</p>
					<p>When it comes to government systems, the ramifications of poor planning can have truly disastrous effects on the health and wellbeing of the general public.</p>
					<h3>In January 2018, a WEA mistakenly informed the state of Hawaii of a non-existent ballistic missile threat.</h3>
					<p>The event sent the public into sheer panic for 38 minutes, at which time the <span class="text-accent-color">Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (HEMA)</span> informed the public that it was a false alarm.</p> 
					<p>In reading about the failure of this vital tool for government-constituent communication, I began investigating the protocol and software that were involved in the accident.</p>
					<p><span class="callout">With this, I became determined to locate and resolve the system failures that produced this erroneous mistake.</span></p>
				</div>
				<div class="padmidsection-medium">
					<h4 class="larger nobottommarginblock-lighter">State vs Operator: Who's to Blame</h4>
					<h3>The investigation started by empathizing with the parties involved with the accident.</h3>
					<p >The FCC claims the accident resulted from a lack of "reasonable safeguards and process controls", but how did the state's alibi differ from the alibi of <span class="text-accent-color">HEMA operator (Employee 1)</span>?</p>
					<div class="flex-imgs text-flex-column-gap phone-and-smaller-1 seventypercentpage norightleftpadding">
						<div>
							<h3 class="text-accent-color">EMPLOYEE 1</h2>
							<p class="callout">Didn’t hear the part of the informing phone call where it was stated that the ballistic missile WEA was a drill</p>
							<p>“Drills were not done routinely in the office.”</p>
							<p>“There was an error in the phone call transmission.”</p>
							<p>“Drill occurred near a shift change.”</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3 class="text-accent-color">STATE (HAWAII)</h2>
							<p class="callout">Believes informing phone call stated it was a drill multiple times</p>
							<p>Fired Employee 1 after he received death threats from anonymous callers to HEMA</p>
							<p>“We simply need to address the problems in order to fix them -- not just in Hawaii, but anywhere… they may exist.”</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="">Regardless of the truth, both the UI and the state's protocol need to be reevaluated. <span class="callout">Rather than play the blame game, we need to accept the inevitability of human error and design safeguards accordingly.</span></p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="padsection">
				<div>
					<h2 class="bold">Investigating the Existing UI</h2>
					<p>Without clear answers about what the exact sources of error were from those involved, I needed to better understand the user workflow for sending a WEA.</p>
					<h3><span class="text-accent-color">AlertSense</span> is the leading software in the WEA space. Based on my research, it is likely that it was utilized by HEMA operators leading up to the accident.</h3>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="padmidsection">While these specs are not the most detailed look into the UI, they provided familiarity with the existing workflow operators follow to send a WEA.</p> 
					<p>A major win was discovering that message <span class="text-accent-color">templates</span> are used to pre-populate the fields within a WEA message. When operators are instructed to send out a WEA they must select the appropriate template from a lengthy <span class="text-accent-color">drop down</span>.</p>
					<h3>Without a clear answer as to what exactly caused Operator 1's error, it highly possible that the operator selected the incorrect template from this template selection drop down.</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="padmidsection-medium">
					<h4 class="larger nobottommarginblock-lighter">Distinction Between WEA Template Types</h4>
					<p class="">A WEA template is either a DEMO or LIVE type. It is important to understand the difference between the two types.</p>
					<div class="flex-imgs text-flex-column-gap phone-and-smaller-1 seventypercentpage norightleftpadding">
						<div>
							<h3 class="text-accent-color2">DEMO WEA</h2>
							<p class="callout bottom">Used for testing purposes to ensure operators and system are prepared when needed</p>
							<p>Usually associated with a specific disaster or event, but not always</p>
							<p>Often signified to public as drill only by appending “TEST” in the message</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3 class="text-accent-color2">LIVE WEA</h2>
							<p class="callout"> Informs the public of an actual impending disaster or event</p>
							<p>Mentions the disaster and what should be done for the public’s safety</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>When studying AlertSense's UI, I noticed that operators have to specify and save a specific template as a DEMO or LIVE type. The only indicator of its type is in the template name and description.</p>
					<p>This means that AlertSense would require users to create a separate DEMO and LIVE template based on if there was a tornado drill vs a real tornado warning.</p>
					<h3>This unnecessarily leads to a large amount of <span class="text-accent-color2">template duplication</span>. This further complicates finding the right template among the long list of items in the UI's template selection drop down.</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="padmidsection-medium">
					<h4 class="larger nobottommarginblock-lighter">Mapping the Process of Sending a WEA</h4>
					<p class="gray">Mapping out the system of sending WEAs allowed me to visualize the <span class="callout">roles of the software, operator, and larger HEMA organization within the larger process.</span> It helps create a mental model for understanding the processes that lead to a WEA being sent, either correctly or incorrectly.</p>

			<div class="flex-imgs-equal-3 text-flex-column-gap phone-and-smaller-1 nintypercentpage norightleftpadding">
				<div>
					<h3 class="">Template names are responsible for communicating message type</h3>
					<p><span class="callout small-p">EVIDENCE</span> Poor naming choices by operators that don’t highlight DEMO vs LIVE type</p>
					<p><span class="callout small-p">SOLUTION</span> Signify DEMO vs LIVE type when sending a WEA rather than creating a specific template for a LIVE and DEMO version of the emergency</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="">Previews for LIVE alerts do not appear different from DEMO alerts </h3>
					<p><span class="callout small-p">EVIDENCE</span> DEMO previews often appear similar to LIVE previews at quick glance, only distinguished by mention of “test”</p>
					<p><span class="callout small-p">SOLUTION</span> Require preview to better emphasize message type so operator understands what they’re sending</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="">Confirmation modal does not display any preview</h3>
					<p><span class="callout small-p">EVIDENCE</span> Operator confirmed their sending of the LIVE WEA while believing it was a DEMO</p>
					<p><span class="callout small-p">SOLUTION</span> Display important details about the WEA in the confirmation modal, emphasize message type more prominently</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="padmidsection-medium">
				<h4 class="larger nobottommarginblock-lighter">WEA Message Type Iconography</h4>
				<p>I started resolving the UI by first designing an icon to visually represent each template type.</p>
				<h3>These icons are to appear in conjunction with the written message type in order to aid in quick recognition.</h3>

				<h4 class="larger nobottommarginblock-lighter">A Redesigned UI</h4>
				<p class="gray">To visually show how my key issues could be resolved, I designed a clickable prototype that demonstrates how I might better organize the process of sending a WEA to improve system transparency for operators.</p>
				<div class="padmidsection">
					<h3>The <span class="text-accent-color2">homepage</span> features all WEA templates alphabetized in a scrollable Template Directory.</h3>
					<p>Compared to the previous UI's template selection drop down, users are able to search through the database of WEA templates with more fluidity and clarity.</p>
					<p>The homepage also conveniently displays active messages with appropriate message type iconography to improve system visibility about active WEAs.</p>
					<img src="images/accident/screens/Home.png" class="singleimg shadowimg padmidsection-xs">
				</div>
				<div class="padmidsection">
					<h3>Each <span class="text-accent-color2">template page</span> acts as the hub for sending a LIVE or DEMO version of the template.</h3>
					<p>Click “Prepare to Send” button to begin the WEA sending process or "Edit" to amend the template. These action buttons separate the task of sending or editing a WEA from the process of reviewing a template's content.</p> 
					<img src="images/accident/screens/View Template.png" class="singleimg shadowimg padmidsection-xs">
				</div>
				<div class="padmidsection">
					<h3>While <span class="text-accent-color2">preparing to send</span> the WEA, users manually select the message type (DEMO vs LIVE) in the moment to force conscious decision making.</h3>
					<p>The number of templates in the system is reduced because the DEMO and LIVE version of a template are stored under one entity. With less templates and a clearer choice between LIVE or DEMO, it will be harder for operators to mess up the WEA message type they are sending. 
					<p>Press the “Confirm and Send” button when ready to send WEA after last minute editing is complete.</p>

					<h3>The improved <span class="text-accent-color2">confirmation modal</span> uses more pronounced signifiers to show a more detailed preview of the message that operators are intending to send.</h3>
					<p>The modal features message type iconography paired with a warning statement that more clearly highlights the WEA type.</p>
					<p>Finally, I ordered the "Cancel" button before the now red-filled "Send" button to further encourage careful decision making.</p>
