			<h3>Voter allows you to plan out your ballot for upcoming local, state, and federal elections based on the things important to you.</h3>
			<p>Compare candidates by economic and social issue stances, news, Q&As, and endorsements. See how their platforms align with your own political leanings and get registered to vote for the next election. Getting involved in the political process can feel intimidating and time consuming. Voter provides the facts and information necessary to make informed decisions, without the noise.</p>

				<h2 class="padsection">Fake News as a Starting Point</h2>
				<h3>I began this project by looking generally into issues surrounding the political landscape.</h3>
				<p>I became immediately interested in the concept of "fake news" and how it impacts our views towards and relationship with politics.</p>
				<h4 class="">I found that...</h4>
				<p>Fake news is more readily available on Facebook than real news, at a time when Facebook's largest growing user group is adults 65+.</p>
				<p>Older adults are four times more likely to share fake news than their younger counterparts.</p>
				<p>The quick circulation of fake news makes it hard to figure out where the original source is or where misinformation stemmed from.</p>
				<p>Older adults often lack technological literacy skills to discern reliable news websites from non-reliable alternatives.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="padmidsection">Arriving at a Formal Problem</h2>
				<p>Reflecting on this research, I began to see how issues like fake news can affect one's ability to access credible information about politics.</p>
				<p>Many people do not always have the time or energy to verify the important information surrounding the elected officials that run their communities, state, or nation.</p>
				<p>Issues such as misinformation logically lead <span class="text-accent-color">towards disengagement</span> from the world of politics.</p>
				<h3 class="callout">Around two-thirds of Americans have reported feeling worn out by media surrounding politics each year since 2016 according to Pew Research.</h3>
				<p>Thinking back to past elections, I remember finding value in social media posts from politically like-minded users that suggested how to vote across your ballot. This was especially helpful when choosing local or state candidates that may be lesser known due to the media's focus on national government.</p>
				<p>Knowing the values and character of those running for each position on your ballot is a time-consuming, scavenger hunt of a task.<span class="callout"> How could there be a better way to explore candidates for yourself in a timely manner?</span></p>
				<p>It was with this that I formulated my problem statement and narrowed in on my target demographic: <b>Americans without the time or stamina to keep up with politics.</b></p>
			</div>
			<div class="norightleftpadding nintypercentpage">
				<h2 class="padsection">PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
				<h1 class="gray">How can Americans make more informed decisions when voting in elections while living busy lives outside of the world of politics?</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="padsection">Service Identity</h2>
				<p>Voter, the eventual solution to my problem statement, would focus on providing users with the <span class="text-accent-color">necessary facts in a summarized format</span> so that Americans can make more informed election decisions in an information rich, yet straightforward manner.</p>
				<h3>In planning my final solution, I needed to envision exactly how Voter could improve the election process and allow citizens to make more informed ballot decisions.</h3>
				<p class="gray">This helped me identify areas in the election process that would instill value in Voter to stand out against other voting-related applications in the space.</p>

				<h2 class="padsection">Branding Guide</h2>
				<p class="gray">Being a tool for communicating important election information, I wanted Voter's typography to have a formal, yet modern feel. Thus, I chose <span class="text-accent-color callout">Helvetica Neue</span> as the app's font. I also sought to incorporate the red and blue of the USA's leading political parties, but in a brighter tint to liven up this patriotic color combo.</p>
				<h3>Overall, this branding is meant to embody Voter's desire to make the election process more approachable for everyday Americans.</h3>
				<h4 class="padmidsection norightleftpadding">Branding Style Guide</h4>
				<img src="images/voter/finalpresentation/Slide9.png" class="singleimg">
				<p class="gray padmidsection">In imagining a logo for the brand, I was naturally inspired by the imagery associated with poll stations and voting booths. The final logo features a check mark you might inscribe when filling out a handwritten ballot.</p>
				<h3>The logo is intended to communicate Voter's positioning as a ballot planning application.</h3>

				<h2 class="padsection">Story Boarding and UI</h2>
				<p class="gray">With the brand in place, I turned towards visualizing the UI and primary functionality within the application.</p>
				<h3> UI exploration was driven by the story telling surrounding my persona's (Anne's) user journey.</h3>
				<p>Thus, I drew out a visual story board with accompanying screen sketches to discern how the UI would aid users throughout the election cycle.</p>
