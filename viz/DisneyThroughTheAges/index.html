                    <p>Beginning with <span class="movie-title-p">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</span> and ending with <span class="movie-title-p">Bambi</span>, these films were all overseen by Walt himself, and established Walt Disney Studios as one of the leaders in animated filmmaking. With the exception of <span class="movie-title-p">Snow White</span> and <span class="movie-title-p">Dumbo</span>, in terms of financial success, the ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù wasn‚Äôt all that golden. This era is known for its dramatic jumps from <span class="bold-word">dark to sweet</span>.</p>

                    <p>With the arrival of World War II, Disney Studios faced <span class="bold-word">lower budgets</span> and smaller teams of animators available for their films. This era, also known as the ‚ÄúPackage Era‚Äù, features films that are comprised of multiple <span class="bold-word">short films</span> within each. They are considered some of the more <span class="bold-word">obscure films</span> in Disney history, and were not wildly popular.</p>

                    <h1><span class="year-intro">1950-1969</span> Silver Age</h1>
                    <p>Also known as the ‚ÄúRestoration Age‚Äù, the Silver Age marks Disney‚Äôs return to making <span class="bold-word">big-budget</span> full-length films. This era is marked by its beautiful animation with ornate backgrounds with soft colors. These films have an <span class="bold-word">otherworldly</span> feel, and make even common day settings look magical. The background animation in <span class="movie-title-p">Sleeping Beauty</span>, for example, was designed to look like a painting. This era featured fairytale storytelling like <span class="movie-title-p">Cinderella</span> and <span class="movie-title-p">The Sword in the Stone</span>, as well as stories from popular books like <span class="movie-title-p">Alice in Wonderland</span> and <span class="movie-title-p">Peter Pan</span>.</p>

                    <h1><span class="year-intro">1970-1988</span> Bronze Age</h1>
                    <p>After the <span class="bold-word">death of Walt Disney</span>, this era was a time of decline for Disney. Disney Studios struggled to find their way without the guidance and imagination of Walt. The era also shied away from fairytales and focused more on <span class="bold-word">darker, secular stories</span>. During this time, there was a shift from hand-inked films to the use of <span class="bold-word">xerography</span>. This saved both time and money, allowing animators to directly print their drawings onto cells. However, the initial explorations of this method were criticized for the <span class="bold-word">heavy black lines</span> that the technique required.</p>

                    <p>This era saw profound success in the box office, with its movies returning to the <span class="bold-word">musical fairytale storytelling</span> that Disney was known for. With <span class="movie-title-p">The Little Mermaid</span>, Disney had produced the best achievement using <span class="bold-word">xerography</span>. Disney also began the <span class="bold-word">Broadway formula</span>, the idea that musical films could easily be translated into live performances. This was also the advent of animators Ashman and Alan Menken, animaters key to Disney's musical success.</p>

                    <p>With little common narrative themes, what really defines this era is Disney Studios <span class="bold-word">exploring</span> new methods of storytelling, such as that of Pixar‚Äôs. With the exception of <span class="movie-title-p">Lilo and Stitch</span>, films during this time were overshadowed by big movie franchises. Though it is often overlooked, <span class="movie-title-p">Dinosaur</span> got Disney interested in <span class="bold-word">CGI animation</span>, which has been used in recent years to create immensely popular films for the company.</p>

                    <p>With John Lasseter taking over the animation division in 2006 and Disney‚Äôs eventual <span class="bold-word">purchase of Pixar</span>, this era is seen as the second Disney Renaissance. The 2009 release of <span class="movie-title-p">The Princess and the Frog</span> was praised for its return to original Disney animation while also taking in nearly $270 million worldwide.
